Sum of an AP
Given n, a and d as the number of terms, first term and common 
difference respectively of an Arthimetic Series. Find the sum of the 
series upto nth term.
 
Example 1:

Input: 5 1 3
Output: 35
Explanation: Series upto 5th term is
1 4 7 10 13, so sum will be 35.
Example 2:

Input: 3 1 2
Output: 9
Example: Series upto 3rd term is 
1 3 5, so sum will be 9.
 
Your Task:
You don't need to read or print anything. Your task is to complete the 
function sum_of_ap() which takes n, a and d as input parameter and 
returns the sum of the series.
 
Expected Time Complexity: O(1)
Expected Space Complexity: O(1)
 
Constranits:
1 <= n, a, d <= 100
